We are Voice Assistance Team 2 - a group of four master students at FAU, collaborating to make a difference in the world. Our mission? To improve the usage of the SENSATION system through the implementation of a voice assistant. This innovative system is part of the Road Scene Understanding for the Visually Impaired project and aims to empower blind or visually impaired persons to navigate and walk on sidewalks with ease. The voice assistant will allow for easier control of the system through voice commands.
